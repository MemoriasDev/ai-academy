## ðŸš€ Learning Acceleration Strategies

### **Spaced Repetition with Progressive Complexity**

**Daily Practice (15-30 minutes):**
```
Monday: Concept review + simple implementation
Tuesday: Cross-domain application exercise
Wednesday: Trade-off analysis scenarios
Thursday: Failure mode planning
Friday: Creative combination challenges
```

**Weekly Integration (2-3 hours):**
```
Weekend Project: Build complete system integrating week's concepts
- Week 1-3: Basic AI applications with monitoring
- Week 4-6: RAG systems with evaluation metrics
- Week 7-9: Production-ready agent systems with scaling
```

**Monthly Mastery (4-8 hours):**
```
Month-end Challenge: Design and implement novel solution
- Combine multiple techniques from different weeks
- Address real-world constraints and requirements
- Present and defend design decisions
```

### **Question-Driven Learning Protocol**

**Before Each Session:**
```
1. Generate 3 questions about upcoming topic using patterns above
2. Identify connections to previous knowledge
3. Predict implementation challenges
```

**During Each Session:**
```
1. Actively seek answers to pre-generated questions
2. Generate new questions based on unexpected concepts
3. Connect every new concept to previous knowledge
```

**After Each Session:**
```
1. Answer all generated questions with specific examples
2. Implement simplified version of demonstrated concepts
3. Generate questions for next session based on gaps
```
