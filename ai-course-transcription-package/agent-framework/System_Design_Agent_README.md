## ðŸš€ Usage Instructions

### For Claude Agent Implementation

1. **Copy the System Prompt** from `System_Design_Claude_Agent.md`
2. **Use the conversation starters** to initiate design sessions
3. **Follow the 5-phase methodology** systematically
4. **Reference the example session** for behavior patterns

### For System Design Practice

1. **Study the framework** in `Hello_Interview_System_Design_Framework.md`
2. **Practice with the methodology** on common problems (URL shortener, chat system, etc.)
3. **Use the example session** as a template for your own designs

### For Interview Preparation

1. **Memorize the 5-phase structure**:
   - Requirements (Functional + Non-functional)
   - Core Entities
   - API Design  
   - High-Level Design
   - Deep Dives

2. **Practice the systematic approach** to prevent going too deep too early
3. **Use "users can" and "system should" statement patterns**
