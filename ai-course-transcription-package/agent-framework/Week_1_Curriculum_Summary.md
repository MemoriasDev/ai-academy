### Course Arc Context

This lesson establishes foundational knowledge for the 10-week course journey:
- **Current Position**: Foundation building (Week 1 of 10)
- **Next Steps**: Moving toward RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) implementation
- **Ultimate Goal**: Multi-agent systems and production deployment

The course follows this progression:
1. **Opening & LLM Overview** (Week 1) ✓
2. **Retrieval Augmented Generation** (Weeks 2-4)
3. **Chaining** (Weeks 5-6) 
4. **Agents** (Weeks 7-8)
5. **Multi-Agent Systems** (Weeks 9-10)

### Prior Knowledge Assumptions

The instructor assumed students have:
- Basic Python programming experience
- Familiarity with software development concepts
- Some exposure to LLMs (copilot, ChatGPT usage)
- Understanding of HTTP requests and APIs
- Basic familiarity with virtual environments and package management

**Note**: Cohort 2 appeared more technically advanced than Cohort 1, leading to potential curriculum adjustments.

## B. Core Knowledge Extraction

### Key Definitions and Frameworks

**Large Language Models (LLMs)**
- Statistical models of relationships between text and probability
- "Next token predictors enhanced by complex statistical analysis"
- Not the first generative text methods (LSTMs, early transformers preceded them)

**Markov Chains**
- Simple probabilistic text generation method
- Predicts next word based on current word frequency patterns
- Foundation for understanding more complex LLM behavior
- Can be applied to any sequence data (DNA, text, etc.)

**Prompting Techniques**
- **Zero-shot**: Direct task instruction without examples
- **One-shot**: Single example provided for context
- **Few-shot**: Multiple examples to establish pattern

**Context Window Management**
- Maximum tokens an LLM can process (varies by model)
- Older context gets discarded as limits are reached
- Critical for maintaining coherent conversations

### Demonstrated Workflows/Architectures

**Summarizing Chatbot Architecture:**
```
User Input → Generate Response → Update History → 
Assess Complexity → Adaptive History Management → 
Summarization (if needed) → Continue Loop
```

**Key Components:**
1. **Response Generation Function**: Basic LLM interaction with error handling
2. **Text Summarization Function**: Converts lengthy conversations to concise summaries  
3. **Complexity Assessment Function**: Evaluates conversation complexity using numeric scoring
4. **Chatbot Class**: Orchestrates all components with adaptive history management

### Best Practices - Do This/Avoid This

**DO:**
- Always use both system and user prompts for better performance
- Provide as much specific context as possible in prompts
- Include example outputs when possible (few-shot prompting)
- Implement proper error handling for LLM API calls
- Use modular functions for reusability
- Consider context window limitations in design

**AVOID:**
- Hard-coding API keys in code (use environment variables)
- Ignoring token limits and context windows
- Creating new chat sessions unnecessarily (loses context)
- Overly generic prompts without specific instructions
- Assuming LLM outputs will be perfectly consistent

### Tools, Libraries, and Services

**Primary Stack:**
- **OpenAI API**: GPT-3.5-turbo for text generation
- **LangChain**: Framework for LLM application development
  - `langchain-openai`: OpenAI-specific integrations
  - `langchain-core`: Core functionality
  - `langchain-community`: Community-driven packages
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **dotenv**: Environment variable management

**Monitoring Tools:**
- **LangSmith**: Comprehensive LLM application monitoring (chosen for this course)
- **LangFuse**: Open-source alternative to LangSmith
- **GenTrace**: Emerging tool, better for LlamaIndex integration  
- **DataDog**: Just announced LLM observability features

**Why LangChain?**
- Most mature and well-documented LLM framework currently available
- Extensive community support and examples
- Abstracts away HTTP request complexity
- Provides consistent interfaces across different LLM providers

## C. Procedural & Practical

### Coding Steps Demonstrated

**Week 1, Class 1: Markov Chain Implementation**
1. Initialize Markov chain with sample text
2. Build word-to-next-word dictionary
3. Implement text generation with random selection
4. Test with different starting words and lengths

**Week 1, Class 2: Summarizing Chatbot**

**Step 1: Environment Setup**
```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import openai
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, SystemMessage
```

**Step 2: Generate Response Function**
```python
def generate_response(prompt, engine="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    try:
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model=engine,
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
            max_tokens=150,
            n=1,
            stop=None,
            temperature=0.7
        )
        if response.choices:
            return response.choices[0].message.content.strip()
        else:
            return "Unexpected response format"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {e}"
```

**Step 3: Summarization Function**
```python
def summarize_text(text, engine="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    summary_prompt = f"Summarize this conversation: {text}"
    return generate_response(summary_prompt, engine)
```

**Step 4: Complexity Assessment**
```python
def assess_complexity(history, engine="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    complexity_prompt = f"Assess the complexity of this conversation: {' '.join(history)}"
    response = generate_response(complexity_prompt, engine)
    
    # Extract numeric score from response
    for word in reversed(response.split()):
        if word.isdigit():
            return int(word)
    return 20  # Default fallback
```

**Step 5: Chatbot Class Implementation**
```python
class SummarizingChatbot:
    def __init__(self, engine="gpt-3.5-turbo", base_history_length=10):
        self.engine = engine
        self.chat_history = []
        self.base_history_length = base_history_length
```

### Key Parameters and Options

**OpenAI API Parameters:**
- `max_tokens`: 150 (controls response length)
- `temperature`: 0.7 (balance between creativity and consistency)
- `n`: 1 (number of response variations)
- `stop`: None (no custom stop tokens)

**Adaptive History Management:**
- `base_history_length`: 10 (default conversation length before summarization)
- `complexity_threshold`: Dynamic based on assessment
- `adaptive_length`: max(base_length, min(50, complexity_score/5))

### Debugging and Troubleshooting Tips

**Common Issues and Solutions:**
1. **API Key Errors**: Ensure proper environment variable setup
2. **Empty Responses**: Check for API rate limits and error handling
3. **Context Window Overflows**: Implement proactive summarization
4. **Inconsistent Complexity Scores**: Add fallback values and validation
5. **Memory Management**: Regular history cleanup to prevent token overflow

**Error Handling Pattern:**
```python
try:
    # LLM operation
except Exception as e:
    # Log error and provide fallback
    return f"Error occurred: {e}"
```

### Adaptation Recommendations

**For Your Own Projects:**
1. **Customize Complexity Assessment**: Replace simple word extraction with more sophisticated analysis
2. **Enhance Summarization**: Use specialized prompts for different conversation types
3. **Implement Caching**: Store frequently accessed responses to reduce API calls
4. **Add Logging**: Track token usage and costs for optimization
5. **Create Custom Message Types**: Extend beyond basic user/system messages
