## üåê Deployment

### Vercel Deployment

1. Import repository to Vercel
2. Configure environment variables:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
3. Deploy

### Environment Variables

```env
# Supabase Configuration (Client-safe)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key

# For admin operations only (NEVER use VITE_ prefix for secrets)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key  # Only for server-side/tools
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note**: 
- Variables prefixed with `VITE_` are exposed to the client bundle
- The `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is designed to be public and safe for client-side use
- It only works with Row Level Security (RLS) policies enabled
- Never prefix sensitive keys with `VITE_` in a Vite application

## üîí Security & Video Storage

### Video Content Management
- **Videos are stored in Supabase Storage**, not in this repository
- The `public/videos/` directory exists for structure but contains no video files
- All 22 course videos (>100MB each) are hosted in Supabase bucket `course-videos`
- To recreate this setup, you'll need:
  1. Original video files (contact course administrators)
  2. Supabase storage bucket configured with RLS policies
  3. Upload videos using the provided tools in `tools/` directory

### Security Features
- All video content is protected behind authentication (Supabase Auth)
- Videos are served via signed URLs with 15-minute expiration
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies enforce access control at the database level
- Service role keys are never exposed to the client (no VITE_ prefix)
- Anon key is safe for client-side use when RLS is enabled
